# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
The proposed method is efficient and reliable for registering and updating attendance logs. The haarcascade classifier is utilized for face recognition from the live feed of the camera frame. Likewise, the Local Binary Histogram Pattern(LBPH) algorithm is implemented to extract features from detected faces and provides the result accordingly if the features match a score above the threshold value. Kindly, check out the presentation file for a brief overview of this project. 

For software requirements, I suggest that your system should be installed with <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">anaconda environment</a> and exposed to required libraries or else directly install <a href="https://jupyter.org/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">jupyter notebook</a> and run the attendance.py file after installing required libraries via requirement.txt file.

Feel free to ping <a href="https://linktr.ee/neel_patel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">me</a> or your inputs via pull request would be appreciated:)
This is totally team efforts and acknowledgement goes with it.
